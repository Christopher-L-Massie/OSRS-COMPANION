# OSRS-COMPANION

This repository is for a website called "OSRS Companion" it is used for tracking your progression in Oldschool Runescape
over time. It will also feature Tournaments where players can compete against each other to see who has gotten the most experience in a
skill over a given period of time. Custom calculators are an eventual planned feature but might fall outside the scope of this initial
project.

With the addition of boss hiscores being added to oldschool runescape the scope of the project has expanded to feature many other trackers on your oldschool runescape characters. Skills,Clues,Bosses and various minigames all tracked!
