# OSRS-COMPANION

# About

This repository is for a web application called "OSRS Companion" it is used for tracking your progression in Oldschool Runescape
over time. It will also feature Tournaments where players can compete against each other to see who has gotten the most experience in a
skill or activity over a given period of time.

With the addition of boss hiscores being added to oldschool runescape the scope of the project has expanded to feature many other trackers on your oldschool runescape characters. Skills,Clues,Bosses and various minigames all tracked!
